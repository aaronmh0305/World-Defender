# X-Squadron
X-Squadron represents an old-school, Arcade style, Space Invaders game in Unity made by me, Aaron Hernandez, and my friend Steven Bajmakovich. All the Art Assets, Programming, SFX, Music, and the entire game design was all made by us! You play as the "Red Leader" of the X-Squadron, and you have to save planet Earth from being mutilated by other-worldly beings with the X-Squadron Team! These 3 Main Allies are called The Blue Devil, The Yellow Hornet, The Green Menace. Each of these allies gives you a power-up in the Campaign! 

You can collect blue EXP Orbs to purchase different weapons in the Galactic Store. The Weapons that can be purchased in the Galactic Store are called the Slice-n-Dicer, the Orbiter, and the Pelt-O-matic. The first laser the player has is called the Terrestrial Zapper.

There are 2 Different Game Modes: Infinite Mode and Mission Mode.  

-Infinite Mode: Fight endless waves of Bugs while trying to rack up some EXP Orbs and a High Score! The Player has 3 lives. 

-Mission Mode: (Currently In-Development) Fight through 4 levels of chaos through different environments, while trying to kill the alien queen and save the planet earth!
